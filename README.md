# About the Project 🎯
Welcome to the **"100 Days of DSA"** repo! 🎉 This is your ultimate hub for daily practice with **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**.  
Whether you're prepping for tech interviews or just want to level up your problem-solving skills, you're in the right place! 🚀

## What's the Plan? 🗓️
For the next 100 days, I'll post a new **LeetCode problem** along with its solution in **Java**.

🗂️ **Repo Structure**:  
📁 `./src/DayXX`:
- Each day's folder contains:  
  ✅ Problem description.  
  ✅ Solution in Java.
